FILES
       $GIT_DIR/COMMIT_EDITMSG
           This file contains the commit message of a commit in progress. If
           git commit exits due to an error before creating a commit, any
           commit message that has been provided by the user (e.g., in an
           editor session) will be available in this file, but will be
           overwritten by the next invocation of git commit.
