       git push origin +dev:master
           Update the origin repository's master branch with the dev branch,
           allowing non-fast-forward updates.  This can leave unreferenced
           commits dangling in the origin repository.  Consider the following
           situation, where a fast-forward is not possible:

                           o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                    \
                                     X---Y---Z  dev

           The above command would change the origin repository to

                                     A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                    /
                           o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master

           Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic
           name, and so would be unreachable. As such, these commits would be
           removed by a git gc command on the origin repository.
